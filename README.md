# CSC209 Software Tools and Systems Programming

This repository contains my coursework labs and assignments for CSC209: Software Tools and Systems Programming course at the University of Toronto.

The course involves programming in C and using scripting languages in a Unix-style environment. The basic topics include: using and creating software tools, pipes and filters, file processing, shell programming, processes, system calls, signals, and basic network programming.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **GCC** (C Compiler or Clang Compiler)
* **Unix Shell**

### Running Files

All Labs and Assignments contain a Makefile to compile all code so can execute 'make' in the Shell to compile all required files and create necessary executables.
```
$ make
```

For individual file compiling and running executables (Mac):
```
$ gcc -Wall -std=gnu99 -g -o <filename> <filename.c>
$ ./filename
```
