/*
  Write the main() function of a program that takes exactly two arguments,
  and prints one of the following to standard output:
    - "Same\n" if the arguments are the same.
    - "Different\n" if the arguments are different.
    - "Invalid\n" if the program is called with an incorrect number of
      arguments.
	  NOTE: Cut and paste these strings into your printf statements to 
	  ensure that they will be exactly the strings above.

  Your main function should return 0, regardless of what is printed.
